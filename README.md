Template to automate GitOps and IaC in a cloud. GitLab CI manages static and dynamic environments, which are created, updated, and destroyed by Terraform, then set up by cloud-init and Ansible.

**The project is under active development.** The project is a fork of [xebis/repository-template](https://github.com/xebis/repository-template).

<!-- omit in toc -->
## The Goal

The goal is to have a GitOps repository to automatically handle environments life cycle - its creation, update, configuration, and eventually destroy as well.

> GitOps = IaC + MRs + CI/CD

## Features

Optimized for [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), easily adjustable to [GitLab flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) or any other workflow.

![Example of the full workflow](images/workflow-full.png)

Automatically checks conventional commits, validates Markdown, YAML, shell scripts, Terraform (HCL), runs static security analysis, terraform-doc, tests, deployments, releases, and so on. See [GitHub - xebis/repository-template: Well-manageable and well-maintainable repository template.](https://github.com/xebis/repository-template) and [Notes And References](#notes-and-references) for full feature list.

Environments are managed in stages:

- **_Deploy_**: overarching name for **provision** and **install** stages
  - **Provision**: environment is provisioned by Terraform at Hetzner Cloud and pre-configured by Cloud-init
  - **Install**: environment is installed by Ansible over SSH
- **Destroy** (only dynamic environments): environment is removed by Terraform from Hetzner Cloud

![Deploy and destroy in more detail](images/deploy-and-destroy.png)

Automatically managed environments:

- On _release_ tag runs **production** environment stages
- On `main` branch commit runs **staging** environment stages
  - Releases and creates _release_ tag when a commit starting `feat` or `fix` is present in the history from the previous release
- On _pre-release_ tag runs **testing/_tag_** environment stages, and plans automatic destroy after 1 week (earlier manual destruction possible)
- On _non-_`main` branch commit under certain conditions runs **development/_branch_** environment stages, and plans automatic destroy after 1 day (earlier manual destruction possible):
  - It runs when the environment already exists or existed in the past (when Terraform backend returns HTTP status code `200 OK` for the environment state file)
  - It runs when the pipeline is run by the _pipelines API_, _GitLab ChatOps_, created by using _trigger token_, created by using the **Run pipeline** _button in the GitLab UI_ or created by using the _GitLab WebIDE_
  - It runs when the pipeline is by a _`git push` event_ or is _scheduled pipeline_, but only if there's non-empty the environment variable `ENV_CREATE` or `CREATE_ENV`
  - It doesn't run when the environment variable `ENV_SKIP` or `SKIP_ENV` is present, or the commit message contains `[env skip]` or `[skip env]`, using any capitalization

**Development/_branch_** environment create or not decision:

![Development environment create or not](images/development-environment-create-or-not.png)

Manually managed environments:

- All stages must be run manually and locally

### Environment

Creates one machine for development and testing environments, or intentionally zero machines for staging and production environments. Each machine uses [Xebis Ansible Collection](https://github.com/xebis/xebis-ansible-collection) roles:

- `xebis.ansible.system`: Well maintained operating system - updates and upgrades `deb` packages including autoremove and autoclean, reboots the system (when necessary), provides `Reboot machine` handler
- `xebis.ansible.firewall`: Extensible nftables firewall - installs `nftables` and sets up basic extensible nftables chains and rules, provides `Reload nftables` handler, see [GitHub: xebis/xebis-ansible-collection/README.md](https://github.com/xebis/xebis-ansible-collection/blob/main/README.md) for usage, configuration, and examples
- `xebis.ansible.fail2ban`: Fail2ban service - installs `fail2ban` and sets it up as a systemd service
- `xebis.ansible.iam`: IAM - creates user groups and users as regular users or admins, their public SSH keys, disables password remote logins, provides `Restart sshd` handler, see [GitHub: xebis/xebis-ansible-collection/README.md](https://github.com/xebis/xebis-ansible-collection/blob/main/README.md) for usage, configuration, and examples
- `xebis.ansible.bash`:Extensible Bash - installs `~/.bash_aliases` and sets up basic extensible Bash aliases, see [GitHub: xebis/xebis-ansible-collection/README.md](https://github.com/xebis/xebis-ansible-collection/blob/main/README.md) for usage, configuration, and examples
- `xebis.ansible.admin`: Administration essentials - installs and sets up `at`, `curl`, `htop`, `mc`, `screen`

### Caveats

One Hetzner cloud project is used for all environments, which brings a few caveats to keep in one's mind:

- To distinguish machines between environments and to separate them from manually created machines they are named with prefix `env-slug-` and labeled `env=env-slug` by Terraform
- To use Ansible, inventory file `hcloud.yml` must have replaced `env-slug` with an **environment slug** before any local manual use
- Use Ansible group `env` instead of groups `all` or `hcloud`, as these groups contain all machines from all environments and eventually manually created machines as well

## Installation and Configuration

Prepare Hetzner Cloud API token and GitLab CI SSH keys:

- [Hetzner Cloud - referral link with â‚¬20 credit](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=arhwlvW4nCxX)
  - Hetzner Cloud Console -> Projects -> _Your Project_ -> Security -> API Tokens -> Generate API Token `Read & Write`
- Generate GitLab CI SSH keys `ssh-keygen -t rsa` (no passphrase, _to your secret file_, **do not commit it!**), file with `.pub` extension will be generated automatically, put `*.pub` file contents at [`cloud-config.yml`](cloud-config.yml) under section `users:name=gitlab-ci` to the `ssh_authorized_keys` as the first element, and commit it

### Set up GitLab CI

- GitLab -> Settings
  - General > Visibility, project features, permissions > Operations: **on**
  - CI/CD > Variables:
    - Add variable: Key `HCLOUD_TOKEN`, Value `<token>`
    - Add variable: Key `GL_CI_SSH_KEY`, Value _contents of your secret file_ created by `ssh-keygen -t rsa` above

### Set up Local Usage

Make sure **GL_TOKEN**: [GitLab Personal Access Token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with scope `api` is present, otherwise `gitlab-ci-linter` is skipped. To run Terraform provisioning Hetzner Cloud you have to set up `TF_HTTP_PASSWORD`, `HCLOUD_TOKEN`, `TF_VAR_ENV_NAME`, and `TF_VAR_ENV_SLUG` required by Terraform configuration.
To load secrets you can use shell extension like [direnv](https://direnv.net/), encryption like [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops), or secrets manager [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), **please make sure you won't commit your secrets**.

```shell
export GL_TOKEN="<token>" # Your GitLab's personal access token with the api scope
export TF_HTTP_PASSWORD="$GL_TOKEN" # Set password for Terraform HTTP backend
export HCLOUD_TOKEN="<token>" # Your Hetzner API token
export TF_VAR_ENV_NAME="<environment>" # Replace with the environment name
export TF_VAR_ENV_SLUG="<env>" # Replace with the environment slug
```

- Install repository dependencies by `sudo scripts/bootstrap` script, setup repository by `scripts/setup`, update repository by `scripts/update` script.
- Set up all admins and users, including public SSH key at [`ansible/group_vars/all.yml`](ansible/group_vars/all.yml) under section `users`, see documentation there. Do not forget to commit it ðŸ˜€

## Usage

### GitLab CI

- Commit and push to run validations
- Push a _non-_`main` branch
  - To create a **development/_branch_** environment you have to create a new pipeline for the branch using API, GitLab ChatOps, trigger token, or by using the **Run pipeline** button in the GitLab UI
  - Alternatively, you can create a **development/_branch_** environment directly by pushing or scheduling with `ENV_CREATE` or `CREATE_ENV` environment variable present, for example by running `git push -o ci.variable="CREATE_ENV=true"`
  - Once created, the environment will be updated (or recreated if it was destroyed) with each subsequent pipeline on the branch
  - Environment deploy is skipped when the environment variable `ENV_SKIP` or `SKIP_ENV` is present, or commit message contains `[env skip]` or `[skip env]`, using any capitalization, or when CI pipeline is skipped altogether, for example using `git push -o ci.skip`
  - Destroy **development/_branch_** environment manually, or wait until auto-stop (1 day from the last commit in the branch in GitLab, could be overridden in GitLab UI)
- Create a _pre-release_ tag to create **testing/_tag_** environment
  - Pre-release tag must match regex `^v(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:-((?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)(?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))*))(?:\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$`, see <https://regex101.com/r/G1OFXH/1>
  - Destroy **testing/_tag_** environment manually, or wait until auto-stop (1 week, could be overridden in GitLab UI)
- Merge to the `main` branch to create or update the **staging** environment
- Creates or updates **production** environment when a commit starting `feat` or `fix` is present in the history from the previous release
  - _Release_ tag must match regex `^v(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)?(?:\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$`, see <https://regex101.com/r/9DFqb3/1>

_Release_ and _pre-release_ tags must follow SemVer string, see [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0: Is there a suggested regular expression (RegEx) to check a SemVer string?](https://semver.org/#is-there-a-suggested-regular-expression-regex-to-check-a-semver-string)

### Local Usage

Initialize local workspace if not yet initialized:

```shell
# Init local workspace
pushd terraform
terraform init -reconfigure \
    -backend-config="address=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/31099306/terraform/state/$TF_VAR_ENV_SLUG" \
    -backend-config="lock_address=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/31099306/terraform/state/$TF_VAR_ENV_SLUG/lock" \
    -backend-config="unlock_address=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/31099306/terraform/state/$TF_VAR_ENV_SLUG/lock"
```

- Create or update environment by `terraform apply` or `terraform apply -auto-approve`
- Get server IP address by `terraform output hcloud_server_test_ipv4_address`
- Direct SSH by `ssh user@$(terraform output -raw hcloud_server_test_ipv4_address)`
- Ansible:
  - Change to Ansible configuration directory `pushd ../ansible`
  - First replace `hcloud.yml` string `env-slug` with `$TF_VAR_ENV_SLUG`: `sed -i "s/env-slug/$TF_VAR_ENV_SLUG/" hcloud.yml`
  - List or graph inventory: `ansible-inventory -i hcloud.yml --list # or --graph`
  - List or graph inventory: `ansible-inventory -i hcloud.yml --list # or --graph`
  - Ping: `ansible -u user -i hcloud.yml env -m ansible.builtin.ping`
  - Get all facts: `ansible -u user -i hcloud.yml env -m ansible.builtin.setup`
  - Configure with playbook: `ansible-playbook -u user -i hcloud.yml playbook.yml`
  - Change back to Terraform configuration directory `popd`
- Destroy environment by `terraform destroy` or `terraform destroy -auto-approve`, and go back to the repository root directory`popd`

Uninitialize local workspace if you wish:

```shell
rm -rf terraform/.terraform # Uninit local workspace, this step is required if you would like to work with another environment
```

Commit and push to run validations.

#### Test at Docker Container

To test your changes in a different environment, you might try to run a Docker container and test it from there.

Run a disposal Docker container:

- `sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/infrastructure-template alpine:latest`
- `sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/infrastructure-template --entrypoint sh hashicorp/terraform:light`
- `sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/infrastructure-template --entrypoint sh gableroux/ansible:latest`
- `sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/infrastructure-template --entrypoint sh node:alpine`

In the container:

```bash
cd infrastructure-template
# Set variables GL_TOKEN and GH_TOKEN when needed
# Put here commands from .gitlab-ci.yml job:before_script and job:script
# For example job test-full:
apk -U upgrade
apk add bats
bats tests
# Result is similar to:
# 1..1
# ok 1 dummy test
```

## To-Do list

- [ ] Fix workaround for pre-commit `jumanjihouse/pre-commit-hooks` hook `script-must-have-extension` - `*.bats` shouldn't be excluded
- [ ] Fix workaround for pre-commit `local` hook `shellcheck` - shellcheck has duplicated parameters from `.shellcheckrc`, because these are not taken into account

## Roadmap

- [ ] Find a satisfactory way how to manage (list, install, update) dependencies across various distributions and package managers
- [ ] Add [pre-commit meta hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#meta-hooks)
- [ ] Add [jumanjihouse/pre-commit-hooks hook protect-first-parent](https://github.com/jumanjihouse/pre-commit-hooks#protect-first-parent)
- [ ] Speed up CI/CD by preparing a set of Docker images with pre-installed dependencies for each CI/CD stage, or by cache for `apk`, `pip`, and `npm`
